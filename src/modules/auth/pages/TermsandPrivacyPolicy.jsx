          WeShopAndShip, operating and trading under the registered name “GABS
          INTEGRATED SERVICES LTD (SC781915),” offers online shopping,
          procurement, and shipping services in and outside the United Kingdom.
          Our services include shopping/procuring products for customers,
          consolidating multiple purchases into single shipments, and
          facilitating delivery/shipping to customers&apos; desired addresses.
          Additionally, we offer payment and shipping services, allowing
          customers to complete shopping/procurement themselves and engage us
          for payment to suppliers and/or shipping services. We also provide
          shipping services for personal or corporate documents/parcels locally
          and internationally. By using WeShopAndShip services, the Customer
          agrees to the following terms and conditions:

            Customers must provide detailed information about the seller and
            products, including company name, address, contact phone number,
            product descriptions and specifications, URLs, prices, colours,
            sizes, etc. Customers confirm that all orders placed will be for
            legal, non-perishable, and acceptable products. WeShopAndShip
            reserves the right to refuse or reject any order/transaction deemed
            fraudulent, illegal, or unacceptable for shipping.

            confirmation. We reserve the right to inspect shipments for
            acceptability.
